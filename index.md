I'm a scientist, founder, and author.
I study ocean waves in the [SUSTAIN](http://sustain.rsmas.miami.edu) lab at the
University of Miami, using theory, experimentation, and numerical modeling.
I also built [Cloudrun](https://cloudrun.co) with my friend and cofounder Josh Noe.
Cloudrun is a SaaS platform for on demand and custom numerical weather prediction.
I wrote a [book](https://www.manning.com/books/modern-fortran?a_aid=modernfortran&a_bid=2dc4d442) on parallel Fortran programming,
and am a founding member of the [Fortran-lang](https://fortran-lang.org) open source community.

I grew up in Serbia where I went to school and worked as a tattoo artist from 2007 to 2009.
I came to Miami in 2009 for grad school. 
During my PhD, I worked with teams from US Navy and NASA to build and improve Earth system prediction models.
You can find all my papers [here](https://milancurcic.com/publications).
Now I write, do research, and build software.
I enjoy doing many things--it makes life more interesting for me.
I live in Boca Raton, Florida, with my wife Evelyn and son Nolan.

I'm here to help. My formal expertise is in wave physics and numerical weather prediction, but you can ask me anything. 
I'm interested in computer science, cloud computing, entrepreneurship, and remote work.
I answer all emails and would love to hear from you.

Some of my older blog posts are below.
My more recent stuff is on [Medium](https://milancurcic.medium.com).
