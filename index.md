I'm a scientist, founder, and author.
I study water-wave physics in hurricane conditions with Prof. Brian Haus
in the [SUSTAIN](http://sustain.rsmas.miami.edu) lab at the University of Miami, supported by the National Science Foundation.
I'm also building [Cloudrun](https://cloudrun.co) with my friend and 
cofounder Josh Noe. Cloudrun is a SaaS platform for on demand and custom
numerical weather prediction.
I'm also writing a [book](https://www.manning.com/books/modern-fortran?a_aid=modernfortran&a_bid=2dc4d442) on parallel Fortran programming 
with Manning Publications.

I grew up and went to school in Serbia before coming to Miami in 2009
for grad school. I worked as a tattoo artist in Belgrade from 2007 to 2009.
During my PhD, I worked with teams from US Navy and NASA on building 
and improving Earth system prediction models.
You can find all my papers [here](https://milancurcic.com/publications).
Now I write, do research, and build software.
I enjoy doing many things -- it makes life more interesting for me.
I live in Boca Raton, Florida, with my wife Evelyn.

I'm here to help. My formal expertise is in wave physics, 
parallel computing and Earth system model development, 
but you can ask me anything. 
I'm interested in computer science, weather and ocean prediction, 
cloud computing, entrepreneurship, and remote work.
I answer all emails and would love to hear from you.
