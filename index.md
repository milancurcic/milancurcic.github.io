I currently do air-sea interaction research with Prof. Brian Haus
in the [SUSTAIN](http://sustain.rsmas.miami.edu) lab at the University of Miami.
We're working on measuring turbulent air-sea fluxes in extreme 
(Cat 5+) hurricane conditions that are impossible to measure in the field,
and use that information to improve Earth system prediction models.
This work is supported by the National Science Foundation.

I am also building [Cloudrun](https://cloudrun.co)
with my friend and cofounder Josh Noe.
Cloudrun is a platform for on-demand numerical weather prediction (NWP)
in the scalable compute cloud.
Cloudrun provides state-of-the-art NWP capability without the 
need for dedicated compute clusters or domain expertise.

I am also writing a [book](https://www.manning.com/books/modern-fortran?a_aid=modernfortran&a_bid=2dc4d442) on parallel Fortran programming 
with Manning Publications. If you buy the book through that link,
I get an extra 8% of the sale price which supports my writing.

I grew up and went to school in Serbia before coming to Miami in 2009
for grad school. I worked as a tattoo artist in Belgrade from 2007 to 2009.
During my PhD, I worked with teams from US Navy, NASA, DOE, and several 
universities on building and improving Earth system prediction models.
After graduating, I stayed in academia but started thinking about 
how to make viable businesses from science.
I enjoy doing many things -- it makes life more interesting for me.
I currently live in Boca Raton, Florida, with my wife Evelyn.

I'm here to help. My formal expertise is in parallel computing and 
Earth system modeling, but you can ask me anything. 
I'm interested in computer science, weather and ocean prediction, 
cloudrun computing, entrepreneurship in science, 
remote work and work-life balance.
I answer all emails and would love to hear from you.
