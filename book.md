## Modern Fortran: Building Efficient Parallel Applications

I'm working with Manning Publications on making a book on parallel Fortran 
programming. It guides the reader through the development of a massively
parallel tsunami simulator, while promoting a modern Fortran style and syntax.
We also tackle a few other real-world applications such as building a parallel 
neural network, stock price time series analysis, and others.
If you're just getting started with Fortran programming, or you're interested
in making your Fortran more clear, expressive, and functional, this is a book for you.
