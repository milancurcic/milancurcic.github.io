## Modern Fortran: Building Efficient Parallel Applications

I'm working with Manning Publications on a book about parallel Fortran 
programming. It guides the reader through the development of a massively
parallel tsunami simulator, while promoting a modern Fortran style and syntax.
We also tackle a few other real-world applications such as stock price and 
weather data analysis, and a minimal TCP client and server. 
If you're just getting started with Fortran programming, or you're interested
in making your Fortran more clear, expressive, and functional, this is a book for you.
The book is complete and has entered production. 
Hard copies are expected to ship in July 2020.

You can get all source code developed for this book on its
[Github page](https://github.com/modern-fortran).
