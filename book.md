I wrote a book about parallel Fortran programming. 
It guides the reader through the development of a parallel tsunami simulator 
while promoting a modern Fortran style and syntax.
We tackle a few other real-world applications such as stock price prediction,
weather data analysis, and a small TCP client-server.
If you're just getting started with Fortran programming, 
or you're interested in making your Fortran more clear, expressive, 
and functional, this is a book for you.

The book is complete and is in production. 
Hard copies are expected to ship in November 2020,
however, you can buy it now through Manning's Early Access Program (MEAP).
To get a taste for the book before buying a copy, download chapters 2, 3, and 4
for free [here](https://www.manning.com/books/exploring-modern-fortran-basics).
Chapter 5 has also been published for free as a [3-part article series](https://milancurcic.com/2018/11/06/analyzing-stock-price-time-series-with-modern-fortran-part1.html).
The complete source code from this book is available on the book's
[Github page](https://github.com/modern-fortran).
