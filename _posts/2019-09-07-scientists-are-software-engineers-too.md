title: "Scientists are software engineers too"

Every once in a while, someone will say that software engineers aren't real engineers.

This usually gets software engineers worked up: 
"Of course we are! We're applying engineering practices to software development."

Some software engineers will say that scientists aren't also software engineers. 
Why not? Well, scientists program computers only to solve their problem at hand and move on. 
It's not real software.

If you don't like hearing that you're not a real engineer, 
don't assume that scientists aren't also software engineers. 
Many of us are.

I wish we could all go back to being just _programmers_.
